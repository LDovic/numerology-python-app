Numerology Python App For Ubuntu Touch

This is a terminal based app I made for my own amusement for Ubuntu Touch. I'm interested in personalities and personality types and I went through a phase of wanting to know the numerology numbers of everyone I know so made this app so I could calculate it on the go. I have some hopes of making this an actual 'desktop' Ubuntu Touch app but for now it does the job. It uses Python.

To run just run main.py
